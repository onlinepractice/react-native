# react-native
this repository is to build mobile app using react native framework. Each project within this repository will be treated as independent project so that teams can work without issues. There will be another project to consolidate the code at later stage.

Authentication Project
Welcome to React Native Authentication Project. The purpose of this project is to showcase all the configurations, coding and techniques required to perform different kind of authentications from the app on anroid or iOS mobile devices.

Before we begin writing code, there are couple of things to check as pre-conditions

3. Running your app on a simulator or virtual device (Android)
	a. Run Android emulator  or connect real android device  (Android Studio -> Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager -> create one virtual device)
	b. Run app: react-native run-android
4. Running your app on a simulator or virtual device (iOS)
