this repository is to build mobile app using react native framework. Each project within this repository will be treated as independent project so that teams can work without issues. There will be another project to consolidate the code at later stage.

This repository contains react native code as set of projects like authentication.

1. Install Android SDK (either install Android Studio or just the sdk)
2. If you don't want to use Android Studio, Install Atom
3. Install Nuclide pakcage on Atom for debugging. 
4. Install Xocde for iOS devices. 
5. Enable development mode in the mobile device.

3. run 'react-native run-andoird' for android device
4. run 'react-native run-andoird' for iOS device

### If you want to use npm tool to run project
1. go to project location (in this case 'path to clone this project/authentication folder')
2. execute command -> npm run <script name> (just execute npm run on terminal)
2.1. npm run set-env (to set the environment like $ANDROID_HOME, $PATH)
2.2.  npm runrun-android (to install node modules and execute command react-native run-android)
2.3.  npm runrun-android-with-bundle (to install android bundle node modules and execute command react-native run-android)

3. Scripts available in authentication via `npm run-script`:
3.1. start
    react-native-scripts start
3.2.  test
    node node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --watch
